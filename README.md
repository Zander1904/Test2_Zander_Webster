Description:

This Git repository was used for the hands on practice of GitHub functionalities, such as:
  - pulling
  - merging
  - branch creation
  - committing
  - updating the project board.

The practice involved working with pre-written Java classes designed to create JUnit test cases for various customer order and inventory features. Changes were committed to different branches, which were later merged into the main branch. Additionally, the project board was updated to reflect the progress of each task.
